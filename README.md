# the-open-art-galaxy
A 3D universe where contributors determine the functionality of one of many randomly generated worlds

## What's the User Experience like?
A 3D rendered environment with lots of 'planets'. You can click on a planet and a 2d background will be rendered, over which a unique planet environment will appear.

## How Do I Contribute as a Developer?
Instructions to come, however, I'm hoping to make it as easy as follows:
1. Create an HTML, CSS and JS file. This is your 'world'.
2. Name them uniquely, and put them in a uniquely named folder.
3. Save them in a 'planets' folder.
4. Either link your planet into the galaxy yourself, or seek help from author to do so. (Discord: matthew-egan-roa-22#7091)
