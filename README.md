# the-open-art-galaxy
A 3D galaxy where contributors determine the functionality of one of many generated planets

## What's the User Experience like?
A 3D rendered environment with lots of 'planets'. You can click on a planet and a 2d world, creating by one of many contributors, will be rendered.

## How Do I Contribute as a Developer?
0. Pull this repo and create your own local branch
1. Create an HTML, CSS and JS file. This is your 'world'.
  1.1 At least one html named "index" is required
  1.2 Link styles and scripts into the html using relative paths. e.g. "./styles.css"
2. Put these files in a folder. That folders name will be used as the name of your planet.
3. Save that folder in the existing folder named "planets".
4. Save, commit, push and make a pull request.
  4.1 If you'd like some (friendly and constructive) feedback on your code, please ask.
5. Once your contribution is merged and github pages updates, your planet will be available.
6. View the live project at https://mattegan111.github.io/the-open-art-galaxy/

## Feature Release Roadmap
1. Ability for contributors to provide a texture for their planet
2. Better controls for user navigation of galaxy
3. Animations and scene layout so that planets are organised into orbits.
4. Animations so the user feels like they're 'entering' the planet
5. A user 'inventory' to make the experience more like a game, potentially with pre-made functions that contributors can use to read and set user inventory data - perhaps using local storage.
